## Introduction

Laravel Chunk Upload simplifies chunked uploads with support for multiple JavaScript libraries atop Laravel's file upload system, designed with a minimal memory footprint. Features include cross-domain request support, automatic cleaning, and intuitive usage.

For example repository with **integration tests**, visit [laravel-chunk-upload-example](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload-example).

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the guidelines outlined in CONTRIBUTION.md.

## Installation

**1. Install via Composer**

```bash
composer require pion/laravel-chunk-upload
```

**2. Publish the Configuration (Optional)**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pion\Laravel\ChunkUpload\Providers\ChunkUploadServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

The setup involves three steps:

1. Integrate your controller to handle file uploads. [Instructions](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/controller)
2. Define a route for the controller. [Instructions](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/routing)
3. Select your preferred frontend provider (multiple providers are supported in a single controller).

**Simultaneous Uploads:** The library must send the last chunk as the final one to ensure correct merging.

**Custom Disk:** Currently, it's recommended to use the basic storage setup (not linking the public folder). If you have time to verify its functionality, please PR the changes!

For detailed information and tips, refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki) or explore a working example in a separate repository with [example](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload-example).

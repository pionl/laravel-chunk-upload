## Introduction

Easy to use service/library for chunked upload with supporting multiple JS libraries on top of Laravel's file upload with low memory footprint in mind. 
Currently supports **Laravel 7+** with features as [cross domains requests](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/cross-domain-requests), automatic clean schedule and easy usage.

## Compatibility
Laravel Chunk Upload ^2.0 requires php 7.2 - 7.4 and Laravel ^7.0.
For compatibility with older versions of Laravel, please use the ^1.0 version of this project.

## Installation

**1. Install via composer**

```
composer require pion/laravel-chunk-upload
```

**2. Publish the config (Optional)**

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pion\Laravel\ChunkUpload\Providers\ChunkUploadServiceProvider"
```


## Usage

Setup consists of 3 steps:

1. Integrate your controller that will handle the file upload. [How to](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/controller)
2. Set a route for the controller. [How to](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/routing)
2. Choose your front-end provider below (we support multiple providers in single controller)

**Simultaneous uploads:** The library must send last chunk as last, otherwise the merging will not work correctly.

**Custom disk:** At this moment I recommend to use the basic storage setup (not linking public folder). It is not tested (Have free time to ensure it is working? PR the changes!).

For more detailed information (tips) use the [Wiki](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki) or for working example continue to separate repository with [example](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload-example).

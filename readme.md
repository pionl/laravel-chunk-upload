## Introduction

> Supports Laravel from 5.2 to 7 (covered by integration tests on all versions).

Easy to use service/library for chunked upload with supporting multiple JS libraries on top of Laravel's file upload with low memory footprint in mind. 

Supports feature as [cross domains requests](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/cross-domain-requests), automatic clean schedule and easy usage.

Example repository with **integration tests** can be found in [laravel-chunk-upload-example](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload-example).

## Installation

**1. Install via composer**

```
composer require pion/laravel-chunk-upload
```

**2. Publish the config (Optional)**

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Pion\Laravel\ChunkUpload\Providers\ChunkUploadServiceProvider"
```

## Usage

Setup consists of 3 steps:

1. Integrate your controller that will handle the file upload. [How to](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/controller)
2. Set a route for the controller. [How to](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki/routing)
2. Choose your front-end provider below (we support multiple providers in single controller)

**Simultaneous uploads:** The library must send last chunk as last, otherwise the merging will not work correctly.

**Custom disk:** At this moment I recommend using the basic storage setup (not linking public folder). It is not tested (Have free time to ensure it is working? PR the changes!).

For more detailed information (tips) use the [Wiki](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload/wiki) or for working example continue to separate repository with [example](https://github.com/pionl/laravel-chunk-upload-example).
